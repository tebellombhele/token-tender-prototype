# Token-Based Tendering System Prototype

A civic tech prototype designed to address corruption in South Africa's government procurement process through an innovative token-based system.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Government tenders worth millions of rands (e.g., R100M for civic centres) often result in poor-quality delivery due to:
- Mismanagement of funds
- Fraudulent activities
- Lack of transparency
- Insufficient quality controls
- Limited accountability mechanisms

## 💡 Solution: Token-Based Tendering

Instead of direct cash payments, the government issues **tokens** to contractors that:
- Can only be used within the project scope
- Cannot be traded or cashed out initially
- Are tied to quality performance metrics
- Can be redeemed for cash only after meeting quality standards
- Are returned to treasury if quality standards are not met

## 🔧 Features

### Core Token Operations
- **Token Issuance**: Government awards tokens to contractors
- **Token Spending**: Contractors spend tokens on approved categories
- **Milestone Verification**: Quality scoring and validation
- **Token Redemption**: Converting tokens to cash based on performance
- **Treasury Return**: Returning unused tokens for poor performance

### Quality Control
- Minimum 80% quality score required for token redemption
- Bonus multipliers for exceptional performance (up to 20%)
- Automatic token forfeiture for substandard work

### Transparency Features
- Complete transaction audit trail
- Real-time spending monitoring
- Category-based spending restrictions
- Performance metrics tracking

## 📊 Sample Simulation

The prototype simulates the **Johannesburg Civic Centre** project:
- **Value**: R100,000,000
- **Contractor**: Ubuntu Construction Ltd
- **Milestones**: Foundation Work, Structural Work, Interior Finishing
- **Categories**: Construction Materials, Professional Services, Equipment, Labour

### Results
- All milestones achieved quality scores above 80%
- Contractor successfully redeemed remaining tokens with bonus
- Complete transparency in fund utilization
- R15M+ in efficiency savings demonstrated

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn jupyter
```

### Installation
1. Clone or download the project files
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Launch Jupyter: `jupyter notebook notebooks/token_tender_model.ipynb`
4. Run all cells to see the simulation

### Using the Token Engine

```python
from utils.token_engine import TokenEngine

# Initialize engine
engine = TokenEngine('../data/transactions.json')

# Issue tokens
issuance = engine.issue_tokens(
    tender_id="T001",
    contractor_id="C001", 
    total_value=100000000,
    project_scope=["Construction Materials", "Professional Services"]
)

# Spend tokens
spending = engine.spend_tokens(
    tender_id="T001",
    contractor_id="C001",
    amount=15000000,
    category="Construction Materials",
    milestone="Foundation Work",
    description="Concrete and steel reinforcement"
)

# Verify milestone
verification = engine.verify_milestone(
    tender_id="T001",
    milestone="Foundation Work",
    quality_score=85
)

# Redeem tokens (if quality standards met)
redemption = engine.redeem_tokens(
    tender_id="T001",
    contractor_id="C001"
)
```

## 📈 Key Benefits

| Traditional System | Token System |
|-------------------|--------------|
| Milestone payments in cash | Tokens for specific categories |
| Post-completion inspection | Continuous quality verification |
| High fraud risk | Low fraud risk - tokens tied to performance |
| Limited visibility | Full transaction visibility |
| Difficult fund tracking | Complete spending audit trail |

## 🎯 Quality Scoring

- **80%+**: Minimum threshold for token redemption
- **85%+**: Standard performance level
- **90%+**: Excellent performance with bonus eligibility
- **<80%**: Tokens returned to treasury

## 📊 Visualizations

The system generates comprehensive visualizations:
1. **Spending by Category** - Pie chart showing fund allocation
2. **Quality Scores by Milestone** - Bar chart with pass/fail indicators
3. **Token Flow** - Waterfall chart showing token movement
4. **Project Timeline** - Cumulative spending over time

## 🔒 Anti-Corruption Features

### Transparency
- All transactions logged with timestamps
- Real-time government monitoring
- Public audit trail capability
- Category-specific spending restrictions

### Accountability
- Quality-based redemption system
- Performance bonuses for excellence
- Automatic penalties for poor performance
- Complete fund traceability

### Fraud Prevention
- Tokens cannot be diverted to unauthorized uses
- Spending restricted to approved categories
- Quality verification required for redemption
- Unused tokens returned to treasury

## 🏛️ Implementation Roadmap (Should it be implemented)

### Phase 1: Pilot Program
- Select 3-5 municipalities for testing
- Start with projects R10M - R50M
- 6-month pilot duration

### Phase 2: Integration
- Connect with existing procurement systems
- Develop API integrations
- Train procurement officials

### Phase 3: Scale-up
- Roll out to provincial governments
- Include larger infrastructure projects
- Develop mobile monitoring apps

### Phase 4: Full Implementation
- National government adoption
- Legal framework establishment
- International knowledge sharing
